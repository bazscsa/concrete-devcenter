##What is BitRise, what can you do with it

To put it short BitRise is a Continous Integration (CI) System.

BitRise associates a step based workflow to the application and when a build is scheduled to run it executes the workflow. 

A workflow consists of one or more steps which are opensource projects that can be imported in BitRise (yes, you can develop your own steps and use it in your own build workflow or you can use one that is currently in the system. The steps can send emails, text messages, clone repositories, pass values to each other and many more. 

After a build is finished you can browse the logs of every step that ran during the workflow or view the Build info. The logs can be viewed as "Formatted Output" or "Raw Output".
