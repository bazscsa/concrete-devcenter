# Update a Step in your Workflow

When a new version is available for a Step in your Workflow you'll see a notification under the Step:
![Step update notification](/images/new_step_update_available.png "Step update notification")

You can update the Step to the new version by expanding the Step's panel and selecting the new version. The latest version of the step is postfixed with **[latest]**.

Your settings for the Step will be kept for the new version unless an input's ID changes - which usually marks breaking changes.
